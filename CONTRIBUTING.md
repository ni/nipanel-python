# Contributing to nipanel-python

Contributions to nipanel-python are welcome from all!

nipanel-python is managed via [git](https://git-scm.com), with the canonical upstream
repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ni/<reponame>/).

nipanel-python follows a pull-request model for development.  If you wish to
contribute, you will need to create a GitHub account, fork this project, push a
branch with your changes to your project, and then submit a pull request.

Please remember to sign off your commits (e.g., by using `git commit -s` if you
are using the command line client). This amends your git commit message with a line
of the form `Signed-off-by: Name Lastname <name.lastmail@emailaddress.com>`. Please
include all authors of any given commit into the commit message with a
`Signed-off-by` line. This indicates that you have read and signed the Developer
Certificate of Origin (see below) and are able to legally submit your code to
this repository.

See [GitHub's official documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for more details.

# Getting Started

This is the command to generate the files in /src/ni/pythonpanel/v1/:
`poetry run python -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=protos --python_out=src/ --grpc_python_out=src/ --mypy_out=src/ --mypy_grpc_out=src/ ni/pythonpanel/v1/python_panel_service.proto`

# Testing

## Simple development loop

```
# Create a new branch
git fetch
git switch --create users/{username}/{branch-purpose} origin/main

# Install the project dependencies
poetry install --with docs

# ‚úç Make source changes

# Run the analyzers -- see files in .github/workflows for details
poetry run nps lint
poetry run mypy
poetry run bandit -c pyproject.toml -r src/nipanel

# Apply safe fixes
poetry run nps fix

# Run the tests
poetry run pytest -v

# Build and inspect the documentation
poetry run sphinx-build docs docs/_build --builder html --fail-on-warning
start docs\_build\index.html
```

# Debugging on the streamlit side

Debugging the measurement script is just normal python debugging, but debugging the streamlit script, or code that is called from the streamlit script, is more challenging because it runs in a separate process that is launched by the PythonPanelServer. Here's how to use debugpy to attach the Visual Studio Code debugger to the streamlit script:

## in the streamlit script, include this code snippet

```python
import debugpy  # type: ignore
import streamlit as st

import nipanel

try:
    debugpy.listen(("localhost", 5678))
    debugpy.wait_for_client() 
except RuntimeError as e:
    if "debugpy.listen() has already been called on this process" not in str(e):
        raise
```

`debugpy.listen()` exposes a port for the debugger to attach to. The port can be whatever, it just needs to match the port in launch.json below. Note that calling listen() more then once will throw an exception, so we put it in a try block so that when the script is rerun, it won't crash.

`debug.wait_for_client()` will pause execution of the script until the debugger attaches. This is useful if you need to debug into initialization code, but you can omit this line otherwise.

The `import debugpy` line has a type suppression to make mypy happy.

## in launch.json, include this configuration 

```json
        {
            "name": "Attach to Streamlit at localhost:5678",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "attach",
            "connect": {
                "host": "localhost",
                "port": 5678
            },
            "justMyCode": false
        }
```

Once you have run your measurement script, and PythonPanelSever has run streamlit with your streamlit script, you can then click the "Attach to Streamlit at localost:5678" button in the VS Code "Run and Debug" tab. Then, you should be able to set breakpoints (and do all the other debugging stuff) in your streamlit script, and in any nipanel code that the streamlit script calls.
